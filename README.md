This repository is a **personal learning journey** into advanced Python libraries that are widely used in **Data Science and Machine Learning**.  
It serves two purposes:  
1. **A resource for others** who are learning the same libraries.  
2. **A revision notebook for myself**, because even mastery needs regular practice.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure  

- Each **library** has its own **folder**, named after the library.  
- Inside each folder, the files are numbered sequentially (`1.ipynb`, `2.ipynb`, `3.ipynb`, â€¦) for better tracking of concepts.  
- At the end of each folder, you will also find a **Solved Exercises Notebook** for hands-on practice.  

Example structure:  
Library_Name/
â”‚-- 1_Arrays.ipynb
â”‚-- 2_Array_indexing.ipynb
â”‚-- 3_operations.ipynb
â”‚-- exercises_solved.ipynb

## âœ… Libraries Covered So Far  

- **NumPy** (Numerical Python)  
  - Learned through structured tutorials, theoretical resources, and self-practice.  
  - Topics Covered: arrays, indexing, slicing, views vs copies, broadcasting, and exercises.

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Resources  

### NumPy  
- ðŸ“º [Sheryians AI School Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utgwk0r9Zq4)  
- ðŸ“– [W3Schools NumPy Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/default.asp)  
- ðŸ¤– **ChatGPT** â€” Used for clarifying difficult concepts, generating personalized practice questions, and reinforcing understanding.

## ðŸš€ Current Focus  

I am currently learning **Data Science** step by step.  
- Each new library I study will get its own folder in this repo.  
- I will also share the resources that I used for learning once I complete each library.  

---

## ðŸ™Œ Why This Repo?  

- To **track my own progress** as I move deeper into Python for Data Science & ML.  
- To **share my notes** with other fellows who may find them useful.  
- To keep a **revision hub** of solved exercises and explanations.  

---

## ðŸ”® Future Plans  

- Add more libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, etc.)  
- Include **mini-projects** to apply learned concepts.  
- Share **Data Science learning resources** alongside each library.

âœ¨ *This is just the beginning of my journey. Stay tuned for more libraries, resources, and projects!*
